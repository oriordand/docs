### How does providing liquidity for wPOKT work?

See [here](https://docs.pokt.network/pokt/wpokt/lpstaking-tutorial/) for a tutorial on how to provide liquidity to the wPOKT/ETH pool on Uniswap v2. And click [here](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0xa7fd8ff8f4cada298286d3006ee8f9c11e2ff84e) to go straight to the pool itself. 

Providing liquidity for wPOKT will be done through Uniswap v2, an automated market maker on Ethereum. In taking a liquidity provider (LP) position in Uniswap v2, you are providing both wPOKT and ETH in equal portions of USD value and putting them into a constantly rebalancing 50/50 basket, rebalancing in line with market price movements. Uniswap Liquidity providers help improve the liquidity of wPOKT while allowing LPs to earn Uniswap trading fees and POKT liquidity incentives provided by the DAO. You can learn more about how Uniswap works here - [Uniswap 101](https://blog.uniswap.org/what-is-uniswap).

### How much can I earn as an LP for wPOKT?

The return from being a LP for the wPOKT-ETH pool will depend on the price of wPOKT and ETH over time, the volume and trading fees earned by the pool over time and the value of the wPOKT liquidity incentives.

For example, LPs earn a 0.3% fee from every trade on Uniswap. The DAO has also approved 2,855,445 POKT in liquidity incentives to LPs, which will be distributed over 90 days from 10am ET / 4pm CET on Thursday 12 October 2024. 

LPs may suffer losses in value if one or both of the assets in the pool fall in value. To see more about the risks of LPing, see here - [Uniswap 101](https://blog.uniswap.org/what-is-uniswap).
See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rYnm7YBuj_b3Q9Ze8dAK-A6u6R149aadZEaYiyw9g5o/edit#gid=2001861994) for a spreadsheet that indicates the potential yield available for those who provide liquidity. There are two forms of analysis: the first describes the basic APR based on the liquidity incentives from the DAO, and the second describes a more complex analysis based on how much it would "cost" to provide LPs with a risk-free return. 

### How can I get wPOKT-ETH LP tokens?

In Uniswap, LPs are provided with LP tokens representing ownership of part of the assets in the pool. This token acts as a receipt which can be returned to collect the LPs share of the assets as well as trading fees earned by the pool. Every LP in the wPOKT/ETH pool will receive a wPOKT-ETH LP token, which will act as proof of ownership of their rights to the underlying wPOKT/ETH (and additional profits) in the liquidity pool.

### How can I stake my LP tokens? 

LPs can stake their LP tokens by going to the stake tab on the **[wPOKT Liquidity Pool Farm app](https://stake.wpokt.network/))** connecting their Ethereum wallet, specifying how much of their LP position they want to stake and then staking their LP tokens. LPs who stake their LP tokens will earn wPOKT liquidity incentives over time for providing liquidity to the wPOKT-ETH pool proportional to their share of the pool.

### How can I claim my wPOKT LP rewards?

You can see your wPOKT LP rewards accruing on the wPOKT-ETH Liquidity Pool Farm page, and they can be claimed every block by hitting claim wPOKT under wPOKT Rewards.

### How can I unstake my LP tokens?

You can unstake your LP tokens by going to the withdrawal tab on the wPOKT-ETH Liquidity Pool Farm page, connecting your Ethereum Wallet, and specifying how much of your LP position you would like to unstake. You then need to remove your liquidity from the Uniswap pool to receive back your proportionate share of the wPOKT and ETH in the pool.

### Why was Uniswap v2 chosen instead of Uniswap v3 or any other AMM?
Uniswap v2 was chosen over the more recently deployed Uniswap v3, as v3 requires a much more active process of dynamically adjusting price ranges to provide liquidity, limiting community participation as LPs. Additionally, the liquidity incentives programs for v2 are much more established and easier to use than v3. Ultimately, the trade-off was between enabling more participation or choosing a technically more efficient option. We wanted to enable as much participation from the community for this initial pool before opening up more complex liquidity strategies in the future.  

### Why was ETH chosen as the trading pair instead of a stablecoin like USDC? 
We were advised that if we had to choose between having an ETH or USDC trading pair for wPOKT, we should go with ETH as fewer liquidity providers are willing to risk their stablecoin holdings instead of their ETH. Given that ETH is still a "risk-on" asset, and stablecoins, by their very nature, are not.  

### Will there be any other liquidity pools in the future? 

Yes, having a stablecoin trading pair for wPOKT also makes sense. And we will likely open up a Uniswap v3 pool as part of the next stage. As well as consider other chains with lower gas fees, such as Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, etc. 

We (PNF) want to have an open discussion with the community about the future DEX liquidity management strategy as part of the next steps for wPOKT. This discussion will likely begin towards the end of November 2024 once we are roughly halfway through the incentivised period for this initial wPOKT/ETH pool.
